# Welcome

My name is Amelia Cruz and I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at UTSA with a projected graduation of December 2020. Throughout this working collection of my coursework, you will find programs featured in Java, C, IA32, Python, Bash, and many others. 

## About Me

I am proud and honored to say I work with leaders in the gaming industry and some really awesome events I have worked are PAX South, PAX East, PAX West, and Dreamhack. Some industry leaders I have come to know are a part of AMD, PCGamer, NEEDforSEAT, HyperX, MAINGEAR, METATHREADS, amongst others.

## 1st-Gen Scholars

**1st-Gen Scholars** is a personal project I contributed the web development portion to. My parents established a non-profit and naturally I was a proper fit for the web development and also graphic design.
